\section{Graph Mining and Social Network Analysis}

\subsection{Graphs and social networks}

\subsubsection{Basic Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Graph G = (V, E)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item V: set of vertices / nodes
    \item $E \subseteq V*V$: set of edges
  \end{itemize}

  \item Graph can be directed (asymmetric relationships) or undirected (symmetric relationships)

  \item Adjacency matrix (sociomatrix) alternative representation of a graph
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $y_{i, j} = 
  \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if} (v_i, v_j) \in E \\
    0,              & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}$ 
  \end{itemize}

  \item Network: used as synonym to graph, a more application-oriented term.

  \item Labeled graph
  \begin{itemize}
    \item set of labels $L$ for nodes or edges
    \item $f: V \rightarrow L$ or $f: E \rightarrow L$
    \item $|L|$ typically small
  \end{itemize}

  \item Attribute graph
  \begin{itemize}
    \item set of attributes with domain $D_1, D_2, ..., D_d$
    \item $f: V \rightarrow D_1 * D_2 * ... * D_d$
    \item $|D_i|$ typically large, can have continuous domains
  \end{itemize}

  \item Neighbors $N_i$ of node $v_i$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $N_i = \{v_j \in V | (v_i, v_j) \in E \}$    
  \end{itemize}

  \item Degree $deg(v)$ of node $v$: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $deg(v) = |N_i|$
  \end{itemize}  

  \item Clustering coefficient of node $v$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item fraction of pairs of neighbors of $v$ that are connected
  \end{itemize}  

  \item Betweeness of node $v$, or of edge $e$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item number of shortest paths between any pair of nodes in G that go through $v$ or $e$
  \end{itemize}  

  \item Shortest path distance between nodes $v_1$ and $v_2$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item length of shortest path between $v_1$ and $v_2$
    \item also called minimum geodesic distance
  \end{itemize}

  \item Diameter of graph $G$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item maximum shortest path distance for any pair of nodes in $G$
  \end{itemize}

  \item Effective diameter of graph $G$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item distance at which 90\% of all connected pairs of nodes can be reached
  \end{itemize}

  \item Mean geodesic distance of graph $G$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item average minimum geodesic distance for any pair of nodes in $G$
  \end{itemize}

  \item Scale-free networks
  \begin{itemize}
    \item networks with a power law degree distribution $f(cx) \propto f(x)$
    \item $P(k) = k^{-\lambda}$ where P(k) is the probability that a node has degree $k$ ($\lambda$ typically between 2 and 3)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Data Mining Scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
  \item One large graph
  \begin{itemize}
    \item mine dense subgraphs or clusters
    \item analyze evolution
  \end{itemize}

  \item Many small graph
  \begin{itemize}
    \item mine frequent subgraphs
  \end{itemize}

  \item Two collections of many small graphs
  \begin{itemize}
    \item classify graphs
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Graph pattern mining}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Given a graph dataset $DB$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item i.e. a set of labeled graphs $G_1, G_2, ..., G_n$ and a minimum support $\theta$, $0 \le \theta \le 1$
  \end{itemize}

  \item Find the graphs that are contained in at least $\theta n$ of the graphs of $DB$
  \item Assumption: the more frequent, the more interesting a graph
  \item $G$ contained in $G_i$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $G$ is isomorph to a subgraph of $G_i$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Anti-Monotonicity Property}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If a graph is frequent, all of its subgraphs are frequent.
  \item Can prune all candidates patterns that have an infrequent subgraph, i.e. disregard them from further consideration
  \item The higher $\theta$, the more effective the pruning.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Duplicate Elimination}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Given existing patterns $G_1, G_2, ..., G_m$ and newly discovered pattern $G$. Is G a duplicate?
  \item Method 1 (slow)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Check graph isomorphism of $G$ with each of the $G_i$
    \item Graph isomorphism test is a very expensive operation
  \end{itemize}

  \item Method 2 (faster)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Transform each graph $G_i$ into a canonical form and hash it into a hash table.
    \item Transform $G$ in the same way and check whether there is already a graph $G_i$ with the same hash value.
    \item Test for graph isomorphism only if such $G_i$ already exists.
  \end{itemize}

  \item Method 3 (fastest)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Define a canonical order of subgraphs and explore them in that order.
    \item e.g. graphs in same equivalence class, if they have the same canonical spanning tree
    \item Does not need isomorphism tests
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lots of sophisticated algorithms for mining frequent graph patterns: MoFa, gSpan, FFSM, Gaston, ..
  \item But the number of frequent patterns is exponential
  \item This implies three related problems:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item very high runtimes
    \item resulting sets of patterns hard to interpret
    \item minimum support threshold hard to set
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Research Directions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mine only closed or maximal frequent graphs
  \begin{itemize}
    \item i.e. frequent graphs so that no supergraph has the same (or has at least $\theta$) support.
  \end{itemize}

  \item Summarize graph patterns
  \begin{itemize}
    \item find the top k most representative graphs
  \end{itemize}

  \item Constraint-based graph pattern mining
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Find only patterns that satisfy certain conditions on their size, density and diameter. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
